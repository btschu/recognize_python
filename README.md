# recognize_python

The goal of this assignment is for you to use your knowledge of programming concepts and identify them in a new language.  There are two code snippets provided below.  One is a list of programming concepts, and the other is some Python code.  In the Python file, file.py, write a comment in the same line of the code with the corresponding concept from the file.txt file.

Comments can made with either a # (single line) or triple set of """ (multiline) and the beginning and the end of the comment.  

# this is a single line comment
"""
This is
a multiline
comment
"""copy
Below is an example of the expected output. If there are more than one concept that is covered on the same line, add them both

my_new_favorite_language = 'Python' # variable declaration, initialize stringcopy
Remember to only use what you already know. If you don't know, this is a great opportunity to utilize the 20 min rule and ask a fellow cohort mate. All of these concepts will be explained in the modules to follow.

The files can be downloaded here.

Concept list file.txt

Python code file.py

Open the files in a text editor

In file.py, identify the code with a comment to correspond with the concept from file.txt

Submit the python file with the comments
